# Ticket_Classification
In the IT sector, Incident management helps to avoid any impact to the business operation by resolving the problem on time. The main goal of the process is to provide a quick fix by assigning to the right group. Wrong assignments will make the process slow down. Around ~25% of Incidents are wrongly assigned to teams which compromises the quality of management. This makes the firm in need of an additional resource to manage these activities. To avoid these problems a powerful system is required to manage these activities of assigning the ticket to the right teams in a short span of time. This can help the firm to minimize the ticket resolving cycle time and ensure the quality of application.

EDA_Models_Tryouts.ipynb contails Exploratory Data Analysis with basic model tried out before considering Fasttext.

Automatic_Ticket_Assignment.ipynb is main file that contains FastText and LSTM model. Accuracy of FastText model is > LSTM. You can generate a bin file and use any model in FastAPI.

*app.py* file is for  FASTAPI uses a Fasttext model which can be generated by running command Fastextmodel.save_model("/content/drive/My Drive/Fasttextmodel.bin") present in Automatic_Ticket_Assignment.ipynb (model size will be huge ~750MB.)

directory Static and Template are used in app.py file for UI.
